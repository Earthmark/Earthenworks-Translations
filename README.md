# Earthenworks-Translations
The localization files in use by Earthenworks projects.

## To verify translations
Use the localization tool at `neosrec:///G-Earthenworks/R-01e2e280-cf48-41b3-bc74-f963a19f9a10` for most Earthenworks objects.

For most projects the root slot is what should be put into the localization tool, from there import your translation document and the object should update immediately.

For worlds, a slot just under root that contains the rest of the world will be the root used for localization. For example, the user made tutorial world has a slot called World just under root that is used as the localization root.
